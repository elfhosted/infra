  rateLimit:
    average: 12    # 12 requests per source IP every .. (this isn't working like I expected, CloudFlare isn't load-balancing randomly)
    period: 1m     # This is a per-node limit, and we have 10 nodes (x), randomly load-balanced, so it's effectively 5/min, or 1 per 12.5s
    burst: 20      # Allow 10 requests in the period to start off with, before rate-limiting kicks in
    sourceCriterion:
      requestHeaderName: CF-Connecting-IP # Rate-limit by cloudflare connecting IP
