spec:
  # Every time a commit is made to the tenants repo, a GitHub webhook triggers flux to refresh
  # Since we have so many customizations, a bunch of requests in a short period can be counter-productive,
  # so let's only accept one per minute
  rateLimit:
    average: 1 # 1 request every minute
    burst: 2
    period: 1m
